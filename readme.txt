This is a team project made in the 1st Semester of my studies (Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras).

DEMO: https://youtu.be/NT-45G3b9ps

This was my first project, using Python, and some SQL.
The purpose of this app, is that the user can register a new expense everytime he pays for something.
Then our app, can provide him with Plots and Graphs, about his expenses per category, month etc.

How to install?
1) Download the source code
2) Keep the Pictures and MyExpensesTracker.py in the same directory
3) Given the fact, that you already have a Python3 version installed in your PC and it's in the Path:
  Execute:
    pip install tkcalendar
    pip  install pillow
    pip install matplotlib
4) Run MyExpensesTracker.py and everything should be like in the demo given above.
